An infinite loop is a loop that has no termination condition, such as `for(;;) {...}` or while(true) {...}`.  These will never terminate unless they encounter
a break statement.  If your program is stuck in an infinite loop with no way of exiting it, unless you are in an IDE, Ctrl+C (for Cancel) will ask it to terminate.
(However if it doesn't your users will be ticked off at you.)  In Java, this will terminate your program immediately since Java can't do signal handlers.  In
Python, you get a KeyboardInterrupt exception that you can catch.

A sentinel value is the termination condition for a loop.  For example, for loops usually have numeric sentinel values (although this is entirely convention;
you can write a for loop however you like, and it will still be legal, but people will look at you funny if it doesn't make any sense).  Numerical sentinel
values should be used in for loops, or when otherwise looping a certain number of times or up to a certain value.
