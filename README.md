My stuff for AP Comp Sci.  

This is public because GitHub won't let me make it private unless I pay them, which I'm not going to do, so all I can say is: NO STEALING.  If your teacher gives you the same exercises that my teacher gives me, please make your own programs!  If you're copying mine you are learning nothing so why did you sign up for AP Comp Sci?  Just so it would look good on your college app and give your GPA a boost?  Well I've got something to tell you buddy: cheaters never prosper.
